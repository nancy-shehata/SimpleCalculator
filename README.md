# Simple Calculator App

## Overview:

**Simple Calculator**: An intuitive Android application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The app provides a clean, easy-to-use interface.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Function**: A 'C' button that clears the current calculation and resets the display.
- **Decimal Support**: Allows users to perform calculations with decimal numbers.
- **Responsive UI**: All buttons are laid out in a grid format for ease of use, with custom colors for different button categories (numbers, operations, equals, and clear).
